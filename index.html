        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hey! I'm Peyton â€” better known as <strong>Foulz</strong> â€” a 17-year-old entrepreneur running multiple online businesses.  
            I specialize in developing professional desktop applications, managing thriving online communities, and building sleek, user-focused projects.  
            With my main project, <strong>SoulHub</strong>, I've created a tool trusted by hundreds worldwide.  
            Outside of tech, I'm deeply into gaming, streaming, design, and always pushing the limits of what I can build. ðŸš€  
            Welcome to my world â€” where creativity meets ambition!
        </p>

        <h2>Streaming</h2>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding or managing my projects, youâ€™ll catch me live on <strong>Twitch</strong> at <em>@foulzx</em>!  
            I love streaming gameplay, connecting with my community, and sharing behind-the-scenes of what I'm building.  
            My streams are chill, energetic, and filled with good vibes. ðŸŒŸ  
            Whether itâ€™s gaming or tech talk, Iâ€™m all about making real connections and sharing my passion live.
        </p>

        <h2>Developing</h2>
        <p>
            Coding is one of my biggest passions.  
            I focus on creating smooth, optimized, and beautiful applications that people love to use.  
            Every project I work on, especially <strong>SoulHub</strong>, is built with precision, dedication, and a drive to innovate.  
            My goal is simple: build tools that feel like magic âœ¨ â€” professional on the outside, and powerful under the hood.

        <h2>Business Life</h2>
        <p>
            Running a business at 16 taught me lessons you can't find in any textbook.  
            From developing products to managing teams, branding, marketing, and customer support â€” I wear a lot of hats.  
            It's not about chasing quick success â€” it's about building something that lasts and leaves an impact.  
            Every day, Iâ€™m learning, evolving, and growing both myself and my brand.
        </p>

        <h2>My Passions</h2>
        <p>
            I'm fueled by creativity and a love for innovation.  
            Whether itâ€™s tech development, graphic design, gaming, or creating content â€” Iâ€™m all in.  
            I believe that passion drives success, and I pour my energy into every project I touch.  
            Dreams only work when you do â€” and trust me, I'm working! ðŸ’ª
