        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hey, I'm Peyton, better known as <strong>Foulz</strong> online!  
            I'm a 16-year-old entrepreneur whoâ€™s passionate about building amazing things.  
            I manage online businesses, develop custom applications, and create vibrant communities that people love being part of.  
            Outside of work, Iâ€™m into tech innovation, creative design, gaming, streaming, and always leveling up my skills.  
            Whether I'm coding late at night or brainstorming new ideas, I'm all about passion and precision.

        <h2>Developing</h2>
        <p>
            As a developer, I'm focused on creating smooth, powerful, and visually stunning applications.  
            I built and run <strong>Zynware</strong> â€” a highly respected tool trusted by a growing community.  
            Every line of code I write is aimed at improving user experiences, optimizing performance, and delivering clean, professional software.  
            I believe in making apps that don't just work â€” they feel amazing to use.

    <section class="section streaming">
        <h2>Streaming</h2>
        <p>
            When I'm not working on projects, you can find me streaming live on <strong>Twitch</strong>!  
            I love connecting with my community, playing games, sharing behind-the-scenes of what I'm building, and just having a chill vibe.  
            Streaming lets me combine my love for entertainment, technology, and real-time creativity all in one place.  
            Every stream is about good energy, real connection, and non-stop leveling up.

        <h2>Business Life</h2>
        <p>
            Managing an online business at 16 is no small feat, but it's something I take pride in every day.  
            From creating and marketing applications to building communities and handling operations â€” Iâ€™ve learned skills most people donâ€™t master for years.  
            Itâ€™s not just about making something cool â€” it's about creating real value, real impact, and building a brand that lasts.  
            Iâ€™m always exploring new ways to expand, evolve, and innovate.

        <p>
            Iâ€™m passionate about design, technology, entrepreneurship, and making meaningful connections with people around the world.  
            Whether itâ€™s launching a new tool, designing a sleek website, or vibing with friends online â€” everything I do is powered by creativity and dedication.  
            I believe in dreaming big, working hard, and turning visions into reality.  
            This is just the beginning â€” and Iâ€™m excited for the journey ahead.
